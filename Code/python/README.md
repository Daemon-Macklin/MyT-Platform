# Python

The python in the project will be used to:

1. Import .dump files into databases
2. Create new data model
3. Export, convert, Import.


Process

## Importing Data

1. Take in dump file location and database type as arguments
2. Spin up Docker instance of selected database type.
3. Import data into database

### New Data model

#### SQL to NoSQL

Take the data model and make it NoSQL layout.

#### NoSQL to SQL

Gonna have to look at every single object and take all of the fields and add them into an SQL command. This will be more challanging.

#### Anything to Influx

This will need user help.

### Spin up Docker container of database
